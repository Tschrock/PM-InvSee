InvSee
------

Lets you see other player's inventory

**In-Game:**
Use `/invsee <player>` to change your inventory to a copy of that player's inventory.
When your done looking, use `/invsee` or `/invsee clear` to get your inventory back.

Since your looking at a copy, you can't actually change the player's inventory.

**Console:**
Use `/invsee <player>` to get a printout of a player's inventory.
